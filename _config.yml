intro: |
  I am an engineer with 15 years experience working in technology. I have primarily worked on the JVM, but have worked across a broad range of technologies thereon: Java, Groovy, Android, Coldfusion and most recently Scala. As well as spending a reasonable amount of time building applications for the web, which has given me an exposure to a range of javascript technologies over the years, through jQuery, extjs, knockout, backbone and most recently to React. <br/><br/>
  I enjoy building interesting products, with a good Product Management focus and a good emphasis on good engineering principles and clean code (having worked across differing languages on the JVM, I recognise that good code is contextual).<br/><br/>
  I have worked in large scale consultancy roles across Europe as well as a mix of startup experience (including one that was acquired) and I am currently the Chief Technology Officer at a legal-tech startup called <a href="https://www.basementcrowd.com" target="_blank">Basement Crowd</a> where we are building innovative products to serve the legal industry.
